============ Sheeple ===========

=== GNOME Contact Management ===

The plan is for Sheeple to be a much more well-designed frontend for the GNOME
system-wide address book. Inspired by Apple's Address Book application, and a
result of the less-than-stellar design of Evolution's contact manager, I hope to
take it a bit beyond what either of those programs do in terms of interacting
with your contact database.

=========== The Name ===========

I have my hopes set high that someone will come up with a better name before
release; I really have no interest in trying to interest people in it with the
current name...

========= Dependencies =========

    * valac (built with vapigen)
    * glib-2.0, gtk+-2.0, etc.
    * couchdb-glib-1.0 and json-glib-1.0
    * avahi, avahi-glib, etc.
    * webkit-1.0
